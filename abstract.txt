This project deals with making a system which possesses the awareness of its surrounding. Using this concept a robot is built 
which, no matter where it is currently, always goes back to its home position for the proceedings of instructions given by the master.

If a robot is in the wrong position at the start of a sequence of instructions, it is guranteed that it will do everything wrong. To initialize
a process, homing can therefore be a precursor.

At the initial stage our goal is to find the image distance using a camera. This will help the robot to take proper judgement and proceed
towards home. This measurement needs to be followed by obstacle avoidance for which the measurement of the object's dimension is necessary.
Also the obstacle can be either static type or dynamic, which needs to be taken care of.

We believe that this approach is novel and crucial for every automation system, hence, through this model we will try to improve upon the technique
and its efficiency.
